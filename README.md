# The Foundations of Symbolic Reasoning

I started writing Occam[^1] with a view to providing an improved front end for existing theorem provers.
There turned out to be little interest in this from the wider community, however, but by the time I had come to this conclusion I was already committed to creating a system of my own for formal reasoning.
The reason for this is that I believed that I had found an alternative understanding of mathematics and logic that was not founded on what might be called set theory plus first order logic, not was it founded on type theory. 
Rather it is based on tenets, what I call the four elephants.
By the way, before going any further I should mention that there is nothing heretical or even particularly original in adopting any of this work.
Much of it predates type theory, for example, and some of it predates set theory.
So, the four elephants:

1. The intuitionistic viewpoint, which goes back to Brouwer[^2].
2. Natural Deducation, due to Gentzen.

Before going any further I will remark that intuitionstic thinking and natural deductive reasoning together represent the most significant advance in our understanding of reasoning since the greeks invented logic.
Intuitionsism frees us from the tyranny of classical thinking and natural deduction in fact separates reasoning from logic altogether.
The reason that both approaches are not more widely recognised might be that both are so ubiquitous as to be almost transparent.
We think, communicate and argue intuitionistically, for example, just as much as we do classically;
and natural deduction is so commonplace in the sciences, computer science in particular, that is goes completely unnoticed.
Therefore if this book does nothing more for the otherwise disinterested reader than make them aware of these approaches then it would at least have acheived something.
Indeed I am going to repeat that in my opinion intuitionism and natural deduction together represent the most significant advance in our understanding of reasoning since the greeks invented logic.

Moving on:

3. Structural linguistics, in particular the work of Frege.
4. What might be termed modern grammars, specifically BNF, regular expresions and Unicode. 
The first two can be attributed to John Backus and Stephen Cole Kleene, respectively.

Each of these four elephants has a succeeding chapter devoted to it,
but because intuitionism is so general, and because it suffuses pretty much all of what follows, it is worth expanding on it further now.
So, consider the following list of questions.
I claim that they are all answered in what follows.
Some may find this surprising or even shocking and some might accuse me of intellectual hubris, or worse, but we shall see.

1. What is truth?
2. What is mathematics?
3. What is logic?
4. What is meaning. 
5. What is a number. 

By what is meaning I mean that if I were to say to you that I did not understand what you meant, what would I be trying to get across? 
And never mind just what is a number. 
I could ask what is a natural number, or a real number. 

The reason why claiming to have answers to these questions, and indeed many more like them, may seem almost maniacal is their general or sometimes even metaphysical nature. 
What is logic? 
You might just as well ask what is art.
No two logicians will agree on a preicse definition of logic and yet here I am claiming that I know precisely what it is!

I will find a way out of this conundrum by way of an example. 
Consider the question what is justice.
Of course there is a branch of philosophy concerned with this question, namely ethics, just as there is a branch of philosophy concerned with the question of what is art, namely aesthetics.
But let us move away from philosophising for a moment and look at the question of justice from a more practical.

[^1]: The word Occam is used somewhat mebulously here.
It covers a suite of software and services together with the the theory that underlines them.
This book is an apologia for the latter and there is a companion book, called The Occam User Manual, that covers the former.

[^2]: Tom Koerner in his excellent book Fourier Analysis wrote that mathematicians make remarkably incompetent historians.
This is not a mathematics book but nor is it a history book.
I atttibute the occasional idea or theory to a particular person, as is usual, but this is meant to be no more than a pointer for the historically curious.
