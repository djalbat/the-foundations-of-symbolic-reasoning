# The Foundations of Symbolic Reasoning

I started writing Occam[^1] with a view to providing an improved front end for existing theorem provers.
There turned out to be little interest in this from the wider community, however, but by the time I had come to this conclusion I was already committed to creating a formal reasoning system of my own.
The reason was that I believed I had found an alternative understanding of mathematics and logic in particular that was not founded on what is usually referred to as set theory plus first order logic, nor was it founded on some type theory. 
Rather it is based on the following approaches, what I call the four elephants.
By the way, I should mention that there is nothing heretical or even original in adopting any of these approaches.
Much of the thinking behind them predates type theory, for example, and some of it predates set theory.
So, the four elephants:

1. The intuitionistic viewpoint, which goes back to Brouwer[^2].
2. Natural Deducation, due to Gentzen.

Before going any further I will remark that in my opinion intuitionstic thinking and natural deductive reasoning together constitute the most significant advance in our understanding of reasoning since the greeks invented logic.
Intuitionsism frees us from the tyranny of classical thinking; and natural deduction separates reasoning from logic altogether.
The reason that these approaches are not more widely recognised might be that both are so ubiquitous as to be almost transparent.
We think, communicate and argue intuitionistically, for example, just as much as we do classically;
and natural deduction is so commonplace in the sciences, computer science in particular, that it seems to go completely unnoticed.
Therefore if this book does nothing more for the otherwise disinterested reader than to make them aware of these approaches then it has at least have acheived something.
Indeed I am going to repeat that in my opinion intuitionism and natural deduction together constitute the most significant advance in our understanding of reasoning since the greeks invented logic.

Moving on:

3. Structural linguistics, in particular the work of Frege.
4. What might be termed modern grammars, specifically BNF, regular expresions and Unicode. 
The first two can be attributed to John Backus and Stephen Cole Kleene, respectively.

Each of these four elephants has a succeeding chapter devoted to it,
but because intuitionism is so general, and because it suffuses pretty much all of what follows, it is worth expanding on it further now.
So, consider the following list of questions.
I claim that they are all answered in what follows.
Some may find this surprising or even shocking and some might accuse me of intellectual hubris, or worse, for making such a claim.
But we shall see.

1. What is truth?
2. What is mathematics?
3. What is logic?
4. What is meaning? 
5. What is a number? 

By asking what is meaning I mean that if I were to say to you that I did not understand what you meant, what would I be trying to get across? 
And never mind just what is a number.
I could ask what is a natural number, or a real number. 
The reason why claiming to have answers to these questions and indeed others like them may seem almost maniacal is their general or sometimes arguably metaphysical nature. 
For example, asking what is logic.
You might counter that I might just as well ask what is art.
No two logicians will agree on a preicse definition of logic after all, and yet here I am claiming that I know precisely what it is!

I will get out of this conundrum by way of an example. 
Consider the question of what is justice.
There is a branch of philosophy concerned with this question, namely ethics, just as there is a branch of philosophy concerned with the question of what is art, namely aesthetics.
But let us move away from philosophising for a moment and look at the question of what is justice from a more practical standpoint.

Whatever country you live in will have various laws, persons, institutions, etc that constitute its justice system.
The law in particular encompasses divers statutes, processes, precedents, etc, adherence to which we think of as justice.
Indeed, we talk of justice being done; or miscarriages of justice; or the wheels of justice, the latter almost as if justice were a physical thing.
Perhaps not a physical thing, but it is certainly mostly tangible and recognisable.
And although it is not possible to define justice precisely, no doubt partly because of the vagaries of interpreting the law, it is still defintely a thing, for want of a better way of putting it.

In fact a better way of putting it would be to call it a concept.
This concept is not universal and certainly not metaphysical.
If you were to move to a different country, for example, then the justice system and therefore the concept of justice would differ, perhaps markedly.
To think of justice in this way is to think intutitionistically.
We shy away from the metaphysical and instead root ourselves in the practicalities.
Or, to put it another way, when considering *definitive* questions we eschew definitive answers and instead offer *definite* ones.
In doing so what we lose in generality we gain in useability.

There is a saying in mathematics that god invented the natural numbers whereas all else was invented by man.
Brouwer would have strenuously refuted this.
You can *define* natural numbers in Occam, along with all the other numbers.
This definition may not suit everyone, but it more than suffices.
Again, when thinking intuitionistically we address the *definitive* questions by offering only *definite* answers.

[^1]: The word Occam is used somewhat mebulously here.
It covers a suite of software and services together with the the theory that underlines them.
This book is an apologia for the latter and there is a companion book, called The Occam User Manual, that covers the former.

[^2]: Tom Koerner in his excellent book Fourier Analysis wrote that mathematicians make remarkably incompetent historians.
This is not a mathematics book but nor is it a history book.
I atttibute the occasional idea or theory to a particular person, as is usual, but this is meant to be no more than a pointer for the historically curious.
