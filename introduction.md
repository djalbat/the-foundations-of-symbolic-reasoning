# Introduction

I started writing Occam[^1] with a view to providing an improved front end for existing theorem provers.
There turned out to be little interest in this from the wider community, however, but by the time I had come to this conclusion I was already committed to creating a formal reasoning system of my own.
The reason was that I became convinced by an alternative understanding of mathematics and logic that was not founded on what is usually referred to as set theory plus first order logic, nor was it founded on some type theory. 
Rather it is based on the following approaches, what I call the four elephants.
By the way, I should mention straight away that there is nothing heretical or even original in adopting any of these approaches.
Much of the thinking behind them predates type theory, for example, and some of it predates set theory.
So, the four elephants:

1. Intuitionisism, due to Brouwer.
2. Natural Deduction, due to Gentzen.

In my opinion intuitionism and natural deduction together constitute the most significant advance in formal reasoning since the greeks invented logic,
because intuitionsism frees us from the tyranny of the dichotomy of truth and falsehood whilst natural deduction separates reasoning from logic altogether.
Both are so ubiquitous as to be almost transparent, however, and therefore their importance is seldom recognised.
We think and communicate intuitionistically just as much as we do so classically, for example;
and natural deduction is so commonplace in the mathematical sciences, computer science in particular, that it seems to go completely unnoticed.
So if this book does nothing more for the otherwise disinterested reader than to make them aware of these approaches then it has at least have acheived something.
Moving on:

3. Structural linguistics, in particular the work of Frege.
4. Collectively what I call modern grammars. Specifically BNF, due to John Backus; regular expresions, due to Stephen Cole Kleene; and Unicode. 

Each of these four elephants has a succeeding chapter devoted to it,
but because intuitionism is so general, and because it suffuses pretty much all of what follows, it is worth expanding on it further now.
Consider then the following list of questions.
I claim that this book provides answers to all of them.
Some may find this surprising or even shocking and some might accuse me of intellectual hubris, or worse, for making such claims.
Still, here is the list, to which I could have added many more:

1. What is truth?
2. What is mathematics?
3. What is logic?
4. What is meaning? 
5. What is a number?

No doubt the reason why claiming to have answers to these questions seems surprising is their general, metaphysical nature.
However, we shall see that intuitionism can get us out of this fix.

We begin by looking at scientific method, which will be familiar to most.
Broadly speaking, when following scientific method we make observations of the real world and use these as assumptions in some theory or other.
We then deduce certain conclusions within our theory, which we ratify by further observation.
If our conclusions match closely with observation then we say that our theory is a good one.
If they do not then no matter how intrinsically appealling our theory may be, we must ditch it, or at least go back and amend it.
The process of deduction will be more or less formal depending on the field of study but what is common to all is that the theories are seen as just that, namely collections of interrelated concepts.
This is crucial because theories that may do a very good job of describing the real world may nonetheless be incompatible.
Consider the hackneyed dichotomy of general relativity versus quantum mechanics, for example.
The hypotheses of both match observation to an extraordinary degree and yet it is common knowledge that they remain ununified despite more than half a century of effort.
It is only the understanding that these theories are wholly conceptual that allows this situation to persist.
We accept that there are different scientific views of the world, so to speak, and indeed the search for one big theory of everyting is largely viewed as na√Øve these days.
Thus scientific method can be considered as a form of relativism.

Desipte this, however, many see mathematics as in some sense special, regarding mathematical concepts as separate from our own understaning of them.
Consider the Platonic solids, for example, known since antiqutiy and commonly believed to have been there for the discovering, rather than being invented by us.
The idea that they were floating around in some ethereal limbo prior to their discovery would have been anathema to Brouwer, however.
He believed that all mathematical concepts were just that, conceived by us, no matter how closely they mirrored our perception of reality.
It is worth stressing that Brouwer would not have denied the appearance of mathematical concepts in nature, the natural numbers being a case in point.
However, he would have stressed that we *perceive* that there are two cups on the table in front of us, say, or three trees outside.

It could be argued that mathematical concepts are nonetheless universal, unlike the concepts in some scientific theory or other.
Unfortunately this is not the case, however, and there is no broad agreement about the nature of any mathematical concept, including the natural numbers.
Fortunately intuitionism gives as a way out of this situation, being itself a form of relativism.
Within intuitionism we can formulate our own ceoncepts and even decide which rules we use to reason about them.
We do not search for universal consistency.

Consider the question of what is justice.
There is a branch of philosophy concerned with this question, namely ethics.
But let us move away from philosophising for a moment and look at the question of what is justice from a more practical standpoint.

Whatever country you live in will have various laws, persons, institutions, etc that constitute its justice system.
The law in particular encompasses divers statutes, processes, precedents, etc, adherence to which and the machinations of the justice system in general we think of as justice.
Indeed, we talk of justice being done; or of miscarriages of justice; or of the wheels of justice, the latter almost as if justice were a physical thing.
Perhaps not a physical thing, but it is certainly for the most part tangible and recognisable.
And although it is not possible to define justice precisely, at least in part because of the vagaries of interpreting the law, it is still defintely a thing, for want of a better way of putting it.


In fact a better way of putting it would be to call it a concept.
Such concepts are neither universal nor metaphysical.
If you were to move to a different country, for example, then the justice system and therefore the concept of justice would differ, perhaps markedly.
To think of justice in this way is to think of it *intutitionistically*.
We avoid the ethereal and instead root ourselves in the practical.
Or, to put it another way, when considering *definitive* questions we eschew definitive answers and instead embrace *definite* ones.
In doing so what we lose in universality we gain in utility.



Now consider again the question of what is logic.
If we narrow the question down to what is propositional logic then Occam can be used to provide a precise answer.
Actually let us narrow it down a little further to the question of what is minimal propositional logic.
Here is an answer:

[Open Mathematics - Minimal Propositinal Logic](https://openmathematics.org/package/minimal-propositional-logic)



Thus minimal propositional logic can be defined as nothing but a collection of inference rules.
Some would argue that this is not what minimal propositional logic is, of course, and they would have a point.
But to *define* it precisely in this way is certainly one way of doing so and arguably more useful than many an imprecise answer that a logician would give.

To continue, earlier it was claimed that we think and communicate intuitionistically.
To see this, consider the statement "it is raining".
Normally, we would not feel the need to additionally assert that such a statement were true.
We would rarely say "it is true that it is raining", for example, or "it is raining is true", since the veractiy of the original statement would usually go without saying.
Indeed it is entirely possible to think and communicate without the encumberance of the dichotomy of truth and falsehood altogether, and we often do.
We use only positive statements, so to speak, whose veracity is considered to be self evident.
And it is enough to assert only that these statements hold, rather than that they are true.
You may wonder, if we do not have the concept of falsehood to hand then how to do refute statements.
The answer is that we have negation to hand.
We can refute the statement "it is raining" by negating it, retorting "it is not raining".
But this is still a positive statement in the sense that it is considered to hold, at least by the person who uttered it.

It is of course possible to refute a statement by asserting that it is false.
We might respond to the statement that "it is raining" with the statement "that's not true", where "not true" is synonymous with "false".
This is in a sense to communicate classically rather than intuitionistically.
In reality we segue between these two modes seemlessly and indeed sometimes it would be pedantic to draw a distinction.
Nonetheless it is important to draw this distinction if only for the reason that the majority of us are vaguely familiar with the classical mode whereas few will be familiar with intuitionstic one.

It is also worth noting that to draw attention to the distinction between classical and intutionistic reasoning is far from pedantry.
Modern proof assistants usually operate in one of these two modes.
Satisfiability solvers are inherently classical, for example, they *decide* whether statements are true or false.
On the other hand modern proof assistansts largely operate intuitionistically, they *derive* or *deduce* statements that hold.
Occasionally verification software can operate in one or other mode and occassionaliy the waters are muddlied, but generally this distinction is a very good rule of thumb.

[^1]: The word Occam is used somewhat mebulously here.
It covers a suite of software and services together with the the theory that underlines them.
This book is an apologia for the latter and there is a companion book, called The Occam User Manual, that covers the former.
